# hello-world
lol I have no idea what I am doing 
Ok...about me. Hi! My name is Sharonda, I'm "none of your business" years old and lives in Chicago. I love running so much that I recently ran a marathon. I also hosts a Japanese/English conversation group(こんにちは!). With the extra time I have with the shelter-in-place and the realization that computer science isnt going anywhere, I decided to learn more about computering. I am excited to see where my skills are in a month! I have never coded before so the improvement will be dramatic at first.
